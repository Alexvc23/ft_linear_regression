Below is a parallel, step-by-step comparison of the code execution and the corresponding mathematical concepts. This will help you see how each line of code relates directly to the underlying theory.

### Initialization Step

**Mathematical Concept**:  
- **Parameters**: $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ represent the intercept and slope of the linear model.
- **Data Size**: $m = \text{number of data points}$.

**Code**:
```python
theta0 = 0         # Mathematically: θ₀ = 0
theta1 = 0         # Mathematically: θ₁ = 0
m = len(x)          # m = number of data points
previous_cost = float('inf')  # Keep track of cost from previous iteration
```

**Parallel Explanation**:
- **In code:** We set $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ to zero, meaning our initial guess is a horizontal line.  
- **In math:** Before learning begins, parameters are usually initialized to some starting value (often 0).  
- **In code:** We determine $m$, the size of the dataset, just as the theory suggests we need to know how many points we’re averaging over.

### Gradient Descent Iteration

**Mathematical Concept**:
- We will run multiple iterations of gradient descent:
  \[
  \text{Repeat until convergence or max\_iterations:}
  \]

**Code**:
```python
for it in range(max_iterations):
    tmp_theta0 = 0
    tmp_theta1 = 0
```

**Parallel Explanation**:
- **In code:** The loop represents the iterative process of gradient descent.
